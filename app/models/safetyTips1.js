    safetySubTitle1: 'Never Send Money or Share Financial Information',
    safetySubDescription1: "Never send money, especially over wire transfer, even if the person claims to be in an emergency. Wiring money is like sending cash — its nearly impossible to reverse the transaction or trace where the money went. Never share information that could be used to access your financial accounts. If another user asks you for money, report it to us immediately.",
    safetySubTitle2: 'Protect Your Personal Information',
    safetySubDescription2: "Never share personal information, such as your social security number, home or work address, or details about your daily routine (e.g., that you go to a certain gym every Monday) with people you don’t know. If you are a parent, limit the information that you share about your children on your profile and in early communications. Avoid sharing details such as your children’s names, where they go to school, or their ages or genders.",
    safetySubTitle3: 'Stay on the Platform',
    safetySubDescription3: "Keep your conversations on the IDo platform while you get to know your match. Because exchanges on IDo are subject to our Safe Message Filters (learn more here), users with bad intentions often try to move the conversation to text, messaging apps, email, or phone right away.",
    safetySubTitle4: 'Be Wary of Long Distance and Overseas Relationships',
    safetySubDescription4: "Watch out for scammers who claim to be from your country but stuck somewhere else, especially if they ask for financial help to return home. Be wary of anyone who will not meet in person or talk on a phone/video call—they may not be who they say they are. If someone is avoiding your questions or pushing for a serious relationship without meeting or getting to know you first — that’s a red flag.",
    safetySubTitle5: 'Report All Suspicious and Offensive Behavior',
    //Bullets
    safetySubTitle6: 'Protect Your Account',
    safetySubDescription6: "Be sure to pick a strong password, and always be careful when logging into your account from a public or shared computer. IDo will never send you an email asking for your username and password information — if you receive an email asking for account information, report it immediately.",
